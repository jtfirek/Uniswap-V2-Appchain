# Uniswap V2 Style DEX Pallet

This DEX (Decentralized Exchange) Pallet is based on the Uniswap V2 design and allows users to trustlessly exchange tokens. It is implemented as a Substrate runtime pallet.

The DEX includes functionality to incentivize users to create liquidity pools and also provides a price oracle based on the existing liquidity pools.

##API

The pallet exposes the following API. All methods are called on an instance of the DexInterface:

###setup_account
##Description:

A helper function to setup an account so it can hold any number of assets.

####Signature:
```rust
fn setup_account(who: Self::AccountId) -> DispatchResult;
```

###mint_asset
####Description:

Mints a given amount of a specific asset for a user.

####Signature:
```rust
fn mint_asset(who: Self::AccountId, token_id: Self::AssetId, amount: Self::AssetBalance) -> DispatchResult;
```

###asset_balance
####Description:

Retrieves a user's balance for a specific asset.

####Signature:
```rust
fn asset_balance(who: Self::AccountId, token_id: Self::AssetId) -> Self::AssetBalance;
```

###swap_fee
####Description:

Returns the number of basis points (1/100) used for swap fees.

####Signature:
```rust
fn swap_fee() -> u16;
```

###lp_id
####Description:

Get the LP Token ID that will be generated by creating a pool of asset_a and asset_b.

####Signature:
```rust
fn lp_id(asset_a: Self::AssetId, asset_b: Self::AssetId) -> Self::AssetId;
```

###add_liquidity
####Description:

Adds liquidity to a pool on behalf of the user. If necessary, this will create the pool. LP tokens are minted to the caller.

####Signature:
```rust
fn add_liquidity(
who: Self::AccountId,
asset_a: Self::AssetId,
asset_b: Self::AssetId,
amount_a: Self::AssetBalance,
amount_b: Self::AssetBalance,
) -> DispatchResult;
```
###remove_liquidity
####Description:

Removes liquidity from a pool on behalf of the user. The token_amount represents the amount of LP tokens to be burned in exchange for underlying assets.

####Signature:
```rust
fn remove_liquidity(
who: Self::AccountId,
asset_a: Self::AssetId,
asset_b: Self::AssetId,
token_amount: Self::AssetBalance,
) -> DispatchResult;
```

###swap_exact_in_for_out
####Description:

Swaps an exact amount of asset_in for a minimum amount of asset_out on behalf of who. The swap fee is deducted from the out amount.

#####Signature:
```rust
fn swap_exact_in_for_out(
who: Self::AccountId,
asset_in: Self::AssetId,
asset_out: Self::AssetId,
exact_in: Self::AssetBalance,
min_out: Self::AssetBalance,
) -> DispatchResult;
```

###swap_in_for_exact_out
####Description:

Swaps a max amount of asset_in for an exact amount of asset_out on behalf of who. The swap fee is added to the in amount.

####Signature:
```rust
fn swap_in_for_exact_out(
origin: Self::AccountId,
asset_in: Self::AssetId,
asset_out: Self::AssetId,
max_in: Self::AssetBalance,
exact_out: Self::AssetBalance,
) -> DispatchResult;
```
